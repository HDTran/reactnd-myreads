# MyReads Project

This is Huy's submission of the MyReads project for the Udacity React course using the starter code forked from the [class' starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), which itself was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Starting the Project
To install dependencies and start the project, execute the following:

```sh
npm install 
npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App and Coursework Starter Code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This project also uses starter code available to all Udacity students for the MyReads Project. For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).
